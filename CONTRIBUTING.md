# Contributing to HubHazard

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.
This way you'll make sure you won't be duplicating somebody else's work.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues][issues]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports.

## All code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Find an existing issue or create a new one
2. Tell us (in the issue) that you're working on it
3. Fork the project
4. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Check if code is safe and readable.

- Ensure there are enough tests the test suite passes. (`npm run test`)
- Make sure your code is well formatted. (`npm run format`)
- Make sure your code is well formatted and lints. (`npm run lint`)
- Update the documentation
- Update changelog ([CHANGELOG.md][changelogfile])

6. Commit your changes. (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
7. Push to the branch. (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
8. Open a pull request.

## Use a consistent coding style

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and ESLint with [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) to maintain code style and best practices.
Please make sure your pull request adheres to the guides by running:

```
npm run format
npm run lint
```

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
